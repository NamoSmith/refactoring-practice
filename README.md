## Refactoring Practice

Copy this template repository to your own Github account. Then clone it to your computer and do the refactorings.  Push your work to Github.

Each subdirectory contains some code that needs refactoring.

1. In this README, write one line describing each refactoring you apply and why.
2. Perform the refactoring in the subdirectory code.


## `time/timestamp.py`

Refactor timestamp.py.  2 or 3 refactorings are possible.

Refactoring:
 - Extract method is_valid_time. (to make it more readable.)
 - Extract variable args and save it in a temporary variable. (to make it more readable too.)


## `game_framework/gamelib.py`

Look for refactorings in the class `GameApp`.

* Avoid side-effects: replace side effect with return value (the caller must use the return value)

* Encapsulate a collection - provide behavior that subclasses of GameApp need instead of requiring them to manipulate a collection that belongs to the GameApp class.
  - Hint: `elements`

Refactoring:  
 - Introduce new variables to store canvas width, height, and timer delay. (to make it more readable and easy to change value.)
 - Add add_element and remove_element method. (for encapsulating elements.)

## `recipe/recipe.py` and `recipe/main.py`

This uses a `dataclass`, which requires Python 3.7.

The Recipe class defines a recipe for a hot beverage with attributes:
* name - name of the recipe
* coffee - units of coffee
* chocolate - units of chocolate
* milk - units of milk
* sugar - units of sugar
* price - (float) price in Baht

Refactor `main.py`.  What can you do to eliminate the long, boring code?  

Refactoring:
 - Create a new function to create recipe, so we can use that instead of assigning its values lots of time (avoid redundancy.)
